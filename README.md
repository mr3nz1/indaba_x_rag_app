# Flask Legal Aid API ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¼

Welcome to the Flask Legal Aid API, an open-source project aimed at providing legal aid services to Rwandans. This API is designed to assist with laws, legal queries, and other legal help in Kinyarwanda. It leverages various technologies, including LangChain for natural language processing, Streamlit for visualization, and Flask for building the API. The project is deployed on Render for scalability and ease of access.

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Render](https://render.com) account for deployment

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/flask-legal-aid-api.git
    cd flask-legal-aid-api
    ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration variables, such as:

    ```plaintext
    FLASK_ENV=development
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
    DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///local.db  # Replace with your actual database URL
    ```

### Usage

1. **Run the Flask App**

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

2. **Access the API**

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the API documentation and test endpoints.

### Deployment

1. **Create a New Render Service**

    Log in to your Render account and create a new service. Select **Web Service** and connect your GitHub repository.

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

    Add the necessary environment variables in the Render dashboard as you did locally in the `.env` file.

3. **Deploy**

    Render will automatically detect your Flask application and deploy it. Monitor the deployment logs for any issues.

4. **Access Your Deployed API**

    After deployment, Render will provide a public URL to access your API. Use this URL to test and use your API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

The following are some of the main endpoints provided by the API:

- **`POST /query`**: Submit a legal question and get a response.

For a complete list of endpoints and their usage, refer to the [API documentation](http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs) (update with the actual URL).
